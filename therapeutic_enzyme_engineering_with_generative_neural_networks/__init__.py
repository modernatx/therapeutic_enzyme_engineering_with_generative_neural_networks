"""Top-level API for therapeutic_enzyme_engineering_with_generative_neural_networks.

Welcome to your custom source package!
Place your code inside custom Python modules (i.e. `.py` files)
housed under `therapeutic_enzyme_engineering_with_generative_neural_networks/some_module.py`.
You can import them into this file
and expose them as your project's top-level API:

    from .some_module import some_function

Now you'll be able to run the following import from your Jupyter notebooks:

    from therapeutic_enzyme_engineering_with_generative_neural_networks import some_function

For more information on how to structure a Python package,
please see the official Python packaging docs:

Feel free to delete everything after the first line of this docstring
once you are familiar with how packaging works.
